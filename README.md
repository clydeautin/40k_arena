# 40k Arena is a game that pits characters from the 40k universe in a fight to death

This game is inspired by Warhammer 40k tabletop game and more specifically the Mathhammer behind the game. Often it's hard to get an idea for how lethal or tough a model might be but finding out the killing impact a model can have can be very useful for your own army or knowing what you're going up against. There are some websites out there to find out the odds of wounds you can place on a specific model but they're all hard to use and not fun at all. So! why not make a game out of it! This project will start as a simple fun game to roll dice and see how many things one can kill next it'll involve into something useful for Warhammer tabletop players and from there it can evolve into a full on Warhammer x Pokemon crossover

 ## Iteration 1

 The game will feature one playable character: Uriel Ventris
 3 Different opponents: Termagant, Chaos Space Marine, Chaos Terminator

 How the game works:

 - Player will select opponent
 - Player melee's opponent
   - Dice roll to hit
   - Dice roll to wound
   - Behind the scenes: opponent makes saves

 The result is then displayed showing off how many wounds the player ditched out and how many enemy models were killed.

 ## Iteration 2

 Let's turn things up

 - Player can now pick different playable characters
 - Round will now involve the enemy fighting back
 - Player can choose if he fights first or now
 - Distance between two models can now come into play
   - Player needs to roll a successful dice roll in order to melee
